Encryptor Malware [1.0.0]
By Alejandro Romeo 2024

This small project was done following a NetworkChuck Tutorial on YouTube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtMMjXOlRQc

* This malware is safe to run, its purpose is educational and I do not intend to harm anybody's data.
* The main script "Encrypt.py" will only encrypt the files in the current directory (in other words, it will only encrypt files that are in the same folder as the script)
* To avoid and prevent any data loss, conserve the Encrypt script in an isolated folder with the rest of the files from this project.
* This project is an exact follow-up of the tutorial mentioned above. I pretend to create an improved version of it using the knowledge acquired soon.
