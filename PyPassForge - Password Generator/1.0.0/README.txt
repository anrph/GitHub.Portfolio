This is my first attempt to create a password generator coded in Python, I had challenged myself to build it by just 
using my current knowledge, without following any tutorial on the matter.


----- OVERVIEW -----
* This Python script generates strong and secure passwords, it's a simple yet effective tool for creating unique 
  passwords for ensuring enhanced security for your accounts and data.

----- REQUIREMENTS -----
* Python 3.x
* No additional dependencies required

----- USAGE -----
1. Clone or download the PyPassForge_1.0.0.py script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where password_generator.py is located.
4. Run the script by executing the following command:
	python password_generator.py
5. Enter the desired length of the password.
6. Press ENTER to keep generating new passwords.

----- NOTE -----
* Ensure that you remember or securely store generated passwords, as they are not stored or saved by the script.
  Use generated passwords responsibly and avoid sharing them with unauthorized individuals.
