Encryptor Malware [v2.0.1]
By Alejandro Romeo 2024

This malware is safe to run, its purpose is educational and I do not intend to harm anybody's 
data. The main script "Encrypt.py" will only encrypt the files in the current directory (in 
other words, it will only encrypt files that are in the same folder as the script)

To avoid and prevent any data loss, conserve the Encrypt script in an isolated folder with the 
rest of the files from this project.

This project comes with two simple ".txt" files to test with. Feel free to create or add more 
files to the current directory to test the script. Remember to back up any important data before 
testing with your personal files.
